SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
 Project Title: Predicting Lifestyle Diseases from Smoking Patterns Using Machine Learning
1.	Problem Definition
 The United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 3 (SDG 3) aims to “ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.” One of the leading global health burdens stems from non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic respiratory diseases, and certain cancers. A significant behavioral risk factor for these diseases is tobacco use.

Smoking is directly linked to increased mortality, decreased quality of life, and rising healthcare costs. Early detection of individuals at risk of developing lifestyle diseases due to smoking can enable targeted prevention strategies, reduce disease burden, and support healthier living.
Our project leverages machine learning to analyse health and behavioural data related to smoking and lifestyle to predict an individual's risk of developing chronic diseases. This directly contributes to SDG Target 3.4: “By 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment.”
2.	How AI Solves the Problem
 Machine learning, particularly supervised learning, can identify complex patterns between smoking habits (e.g., frequency, duration, exposure) and disease outcomes. By training our model on a labelled dataset that includes smoking behaviour, demographics, and health indicators, we aim to:

●	Predict the likelihood of developing a lifestyle disease.

●	Enable early screening and intervention for at-risk individuals.

●	Support healthcare professionals in designing personalized prevention plans.

●	Inform public health campaigns with data-driven insights.

3.	Ethical Reflection

a. Potential Biases
●	Sample Bias: If the dataset underrepresents certain groups (e.g., non-smokers, females, younger populations), predictions may be skewed or less accurate for those groups.

●	Labeling Bias: Disease labels may rely on self-reporting or incomplete diagnoses, affecting model accuracy.

●	Socioeconomic Bias: Features such as education level or income might act as proxies for broader inequalities if not carefully handled.

b. Fairness & Equity Promotion
●	Data Diversity: By using openly available, demographically rich datasets, we aim to ensure broad representation in training data.

●	Preventive Focus: The model aims to assist in identifying high-risk individuals early, which promotes health equity by making interventions accessible before symptoms develop.

●	Explainability: We focus on building interpretable models that allow users and health practitioners to understand which features contributed to a given prediction.

●	Ethical Use: The tool is not intended to diagnose but to support informed health decisions and personalized care with transparency and respect for individual autonomy.
